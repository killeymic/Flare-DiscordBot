Flare is a plugin-based bot â€“ meaning all features and commands can be enabled/disabled to your liking, simply by adding or removing some files!

Although this version is *self-hosted* only, we have a hosted version in the works that will have features similar to Dyno or Mee6.

Installation requires no more than the knowledge to unzip a file, although a basic understanding of Java will make this an even more powerful tool.
